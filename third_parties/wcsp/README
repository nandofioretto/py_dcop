WCSPLift
--------

To build the source code, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++ 11 (the code is known to build with gcc 4.9)
- A POSIX-compliant system
- BLAS
- The boost library
- The Gurobi optimizer
- cmake (build dependency only)

To build the binary executable, you can follow the standard cmake project building procedure:

    cmake .
    make

The executable will be put under the "bin" directory named "wcsp". Run the executable with the
"--help" option to view available options.

The default input file format is DIMACS: http://graphmod.ics.uci.edu/group/WCSP_file_format

As a shortcut, to solve a WCSP instance using message passing on the Constraint Composite Graph,
simply use the following command:

    wcsp -m m [input-file]

To build the documentation, please read doc/README.

- [] Implement CCG DSA

    Prior doing the following check the size of the sub-problem of the agents -- how many local variables, how many
    shared variables?
- [] Implement version of CCG-maxsum where agents only take pointers to the nodes
- [] Implement version of CCG-maxsum / dsa where agents use gurobi to solve local problems and exchange messages
     only with their neighbors to try to minimize conflicts.
